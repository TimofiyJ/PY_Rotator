**Have you ever wanted to rotate your image to the correct angle using just a one-line command?**

**Well, image rotator is the solution for your problem!**

## Instruction

**Attention. It is recommended to have python 3.8 version so all the libraries would run correctly**

* Download the current repo and run the command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* How, when all the dependencies all installed, run the following command in the script folder

```
python .\correct_skew.py -i IMAGE -o OUTPUT
```
Note: IMAGE - path to your image. OUTPUT - path to the script output (rotated picture)

**That's it! Only with the help of one command you installed all the necessary dependencies and your script is ready-to-run!**

*This is a gif of how the solution works*
